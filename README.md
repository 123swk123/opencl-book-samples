![GitHub Logo](logo.img) OpenCL Programming Guide 1.2 Examples
=======================================================================

This project contains all of the source code to the example programs
from the OpenCL Programming Guide. Instructions on checking out the
source code and building it on various platforms can be found on the
Installation page.

This book is getting old now and I'm pleased to say that we are
working on new version that will cover OpenCL 2.1; more information
soon.
